# Malware Attack Response and Mitigation

## Overview
This repository contains documentation and resources related to our response to a recent malware attack, including analysis of the attack, technical steps taken to mitigate it, and the incident postmortem.

## Tasks
### 1. Responding to the Malware Attack
- Description: Begin by triaging the current malware threat to identify affected infrastructure. Notify relevant teams promptly to initiate mitigation efforts.
- Procedure:
   1. **Triage the Malware Threat**:
      - Use available security tools and logs to assess the scope of the attack.
      - Prioritize identifying key infrastructure under attack for effective resource allocation.
   2. **Notify Relevant Teams**:
      - Draft a concise email alerting the respective teams of the ongoing attack and providing necessary details for mitigation.
   3. **Incident Documentation**:
      - Maintain a log of all communications and initial observations for reference.

### 2. Analyzing the Attack
- Description: Analyze firewall logs to gather insights into the attack. Identify the exploited vulnerability and communicate findings to the networks team for mitigation.
- Procedure:
   1. **Analyze Firewall Logs**:
      - Review provided firewall logs to detect patterns indicative of malicious activity.
   2. **Identify Exploited Vulnerability**:
      - Research and identify the specific characteristics of the exploited vulnerability, such as the Spring4Shell vulnerability.
   3. **Communicate Findings to Networks Team**:
      - Present analysis findings in a concise email to enable swift development of firewall rules for mitigation.

### 3. (Technical) Mitigate the Malware Attack
- Description: Utilize Python to develop a firewall rule aimed at mitigating the attack.
- Procedure:
   1. **Develop Firewall Rule**:
      - Create a firewall rule using Python within the `firewall_server.py` file.
   2. **Upload Specific Files for Review**:
      - Ensure only relevant files, such as `firewall_server.py`, are uploaded for review.
   3. **Test Firewall Rule Effectiveness**:
      - Conduct testing with `test_requests.py` to verify the rule's effectiveness.

### 4. Incident Postmortem
- Description: Conduct a comprehensive review of the incident, including root cause analysis, lessons learned, and recommendations for future improvements.
- Procedure:
   - **Incident Timeline**: Outline the timeline of the incident from discovery to resolution.
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of the incident, such as the exploitation of the Spring4Shell vulnerability.
   - **Lessons Learned**: Highlight lessons learned, including the importance of proactive monitoring and rapid response to cybersecurity threats.
   - **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations for future improvements, such as enhanced monitoring and regular vulnerability scans.
